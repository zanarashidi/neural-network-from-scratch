# Simple Feed Forward Neural Network and Backpropagation using NumPy

## About 
This repository contains a simple and customizable feed forward neural network and backpropagation using only NumPy. The dataset used for this experiment is MNIST.

## How to use
```bash
$ python feedforward.py
```

## Hyperparameters
Hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, number of neurons, activation functions, learning rate, etc can be modified inside the code. 

## Requirements
The main requirements for this project are **Python** and **NumPy**.
